# 🧠 CT + Hebrew Clinical Text Classifier

This project classifies brain CT scans and their corresponding Hebrew clinical descriptions into one of three classes:
- **Normal**
- **Near Normal**
- **Abnormal**

The model uses a deep learning architecture with **cross-attention** between image features (CT scans) and text features (Hebrew clinical notes).

## 🧪 Requirements

Install all dependencies using `conda`:

```bash
conda env create -f env.yml
conda activate nnn
````

---

## 🚀 Training

Run the training pipeline:

```bash
python main.py --epochs 10 --batch_size 16 --lr 1e-4
```

You can resume from a checkpoint:

```bash
python main.py --resume checkpoint_epoch_5.pt
```

---

## 🧠 Model

The model is based on:

* A **BERT-based** text encoder (`bert-base-multilingual-cased`) for Hebrew input
* A **CNN-based** CT encoder
* A **multi-head cross-attention** layer connecting the two modalities
* A final classification layer with 3 output classes

---

## 📊 Evaluation

Training and validation accuracy/loss is logged per epoch. Add your own test set evaluation logic under `train.py`.
