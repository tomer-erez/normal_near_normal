1. 
for training only take examples with 4 or more words
train_text_augmented = train_df["text_augment"].astype(str).str.split().apply(len)
short_texts = train_df[train_text == 3]["text_augment"]

there are 500 examples of 3 words that look like:

['Results: Impression:']

these wouldnt be helpful for training probably because how would we align it
